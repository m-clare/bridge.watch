                  <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    As a software developer and structural engineer, I like
                    building useful tools. After starting my career in bridge
                    design, I've since worked on the design of several landmark
                    structures before concentrating on software development.
                    While I've spent much of my career focusing on the details
                    of how a structure gets put together, I also like to tackle
                    larger problems surrounding the built environment and making
                    the work of structural engineers more visible to the public.

                    space and resources for me to become a better programmer and
                    connecting me to a supportive community. In particular I'd
                    like to thank Ryan Prior and Shae Erisson for being so
                    generous with their time and expertise. Thanks to Patrick
                    Mineault, Kracekumar, and Jim Kang for their help/pairing on
                    various issues, and thanks to Ksenia Tretiakova and Diederik
                    Veenendaal for their design feedback.
